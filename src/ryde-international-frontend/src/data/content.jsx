                The NWBrand is designed to resist the notion that hard work
                isn’t sexy work. In our society, there is a level of
                misconception which drives the idea that as individuals we
                should choose to be one thing, often via the path of least
                resistance: <span>I don’t agree.</span>
                <br></br>I believe that purposeful work leads to rich moments,
                and that these moments underpin shifts in knowledge,
                understanding, capacity and beliefs which are both permanent and
                powerful.
